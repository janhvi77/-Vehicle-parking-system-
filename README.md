🚗 Vehicle Parking Management System

A simple yet functional C-language-based terminal application for managing vehicle parking operations. This project simulates a parking management system that tracks vehicle entries, calculates charges, and displays data summaries in real time.

📌 Description

The Vehicle Parking Management System is a command-line project developed in C that helps manage different types of vehicle parking. It records entries for buses, cars, rikshas, and two-wheelers while keeping track of the total number of vehicles and the total collection amount.

Every time a vehicle enters, it displays a welcome message, logs the parking time, and calculates the parking charge accordingly. It also allows you to view current parking statistics or clear all data. This is an ideal project for C beginners looking to explore real-world system simulations.
